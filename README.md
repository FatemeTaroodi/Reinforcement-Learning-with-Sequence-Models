# Reinforcement-Learning-with-Sequence-Models
**Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning with Sequence Models section of my GitHub repository! This section contains materials from my Spring 2025 presentation for the Pattern Recognition course. It focuses on introducing key concepts of how sequence models (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers) enhance reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to tackle challenges like partial observability and long-term dependencies. The goal is conceptual understanding, not coding, though code examples may be added in the future.**
This presentation covers:

RL with Sequence Models: Integrating sequence models into RL for partially observable environments (POMDPs).
Sequence Models: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), and Transformers.
POMDPs: Handling partial observability in RL, with examples like dialogue systems and robotics.
RL for Language Models: Using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align language models with human preferences.
Multi-Step RL: Applying RL to sequential tasks like dialogue systems and text games.
Key Algorithms: Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN) and Decision Transformer.

**Why This Topic?**
Reinforcement Learning with Sequence Models is a cutting-edge approach for solving real-world problems where agents make decisions with incomplete information or need to track long-term dependencies. This section is ideal for:

Students and researchers studying RL, sequence models, or their applications.
Practitioners interested in RLHF, dialogue systems, or advanced RL techniques.
Anyone curious about how Transformers and RL intersect.
