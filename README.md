# Reinforcement-Learning-with-Sequence-Models
Reinforcement Learning with Sequence Models  Materials from my Spring 2025 Pattern Recognition presentation, exploring how RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers enhance RL for POMDPs, RLHF, and tasks like dialogue systems. Includes slides and resources on DRQN and Decision Transformers for researchers and students.
